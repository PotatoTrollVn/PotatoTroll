--After you executed the script loadstring thing then.

--Execute this script.

_G.toggle = "f"

_G.reaction_time = 100 -- how fast it aims to the next block

_G.sensitivity = 15 -- sensitivity of the aimbot, 9-10 is recommended unless you wanna have a seizure

_G.smoothness = 0.01 -- smoothness of the movement, lower is snappier but faster. If you wanna be a god just set it to 0.04 or lower

_G.movement = Enum.EasingStyle.Linear -- type of aimbot movement, just use linear
